To successfully start a program you need to have a local server or other PHP development environment (I used XAMPP).

Clone repository. 
With XAMPP it is important to place the project folder in xampp->htdocs.
Start web server software (In my case Apache).
Start Database (MySQL).
In your web browser type: localhost/_folder-name

It will automatically open index.php file

To see all displayed data open: _localhost/_folder-name/storage.php

on branch - _front-end _- _is code without PHP. (Pure HTML, Javascript and CSS)
